# Telebot Planning
- [ ] Bot should be an opt-in mechanism on group chats
- [ ] Bot should have a way to store expenses outside of reading old
      messages (It could but needs to read only the latest) (Can store the state in description)
- [ ] Bot should have a few commands /tab, /add, /delete, /help

# Dev
``` bash
make switch
```

# Test

``` bas
make test
```
